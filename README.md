# School_District_Analysis
Project 4 of Data Analytics Bootcamp. Learning to use Python Libraries with school district data.
## Resources
* Python version 3.8.8
* Anaconda version 4.9.2
* Files used: [student_complete.csv](https://github.com/RuthLD/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/students_complete.csv) and [school_complete.csv](https://github.com/RuthLD/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/schools_complete.csv)
## Analysis Overview
The purpose of the analysis was to provide a high - level snapshot of the school district's key metrics, math and reading scores. As well as editing scores affected by academic dishonesty from Thomas High School's 9th grade. The information was requested in a table format.
### Initial School District Summary
* Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  * ![Top 5 Schools by % Overall Passing](https://github.com/RuthLD/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Top_5_S_D_A.png)
  * ![Bottom 5 Schools by % Overall Passing](https://github.com/RuthLD/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Bottom_5_S_D_A.png)
* The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
 * ![Average Math Score by Grade Level](https://github.com/RuthLD/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Avg_Math_by_grade.png)
* The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
 * ![Average Reading Score by Grade Level](https://github.com/RuthLD/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Avg_Read_by_grade.png)
* School performance based on the budget per student
![School Performance by Budget per Student](https://github.com/RuthLD/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Perform_by_budget_per_student.png)
* School performance based on the school size

### Corrected School District Summary  
* Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  * ![Top 5 Schools by % Overall Passing after Correction](https://github.com/RuthLD/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Top_5_Corrected.png)
  * ![Bottom 5 Schools by % Overall Passing after Correction](https://github.com/RuthLD/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Botton_5_Corrected.png)
* The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
 * ![Corrected Average Math Score by Grade Level](https://github.com/RuthLD/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Corrected_Avg_Math_by_grade.png)
* The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
 * ![Corrected Average Reading Score by Grade Level](https://github.com/RuthLD/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Corrected_Avg_Reading_by_grade.png)
* School performance based on the budget per student
